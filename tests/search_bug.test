# Test for search bug: empty search should show all files, not "no files found"

# Start in navigator panel
assert:active_panel:Navigator

# Enter search mode
char:/

# At this point, search string is empty and should show all files
# Let's check if we're in search mode and what's displayed
wait:100

# The bug: empty search shows "no files found" instead of all files
# We should see files listed, not an error message

# Try typing a character to see if search works
char:s

# Wait for search results
wait:100

# Clear the search character (backspace)
key:backspace

# Now we're back to empty search - this should show all files again
wait:100

# Exit search mode
key:esc

# Verify we're back to normal navigation
assert:active_panel:Navigator

# Exit
key:q
