# Test that searching for "rea" properly selects README.md
# This reproduces the bug where search finds files but doesn't select them

# Start search mode
char:/

# Check initial state - should have no selection after starting search
assert:selected_file:none

# Type "r" - should auto-select first match
char:r
assert:selected_file:README.md

# Type "e" - should keep README.md selected
char:e
assert:selected_file:README.md

# Type "a" - should still have README.md selected
char:a
assert:selected_file:README.md

# Take a screenshot to verify the visual state
