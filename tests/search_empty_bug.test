# Test to reproduce search bug: empty search should show all files, not "no files found"

# Start in navigator panel
assert:active_panel:Navigator

# Check how many files are visible initially (top-level items only)
assert:visible_files_count:19

# Enter search mode with '/'
char:/

# Now we're in search mode with empty query - this should show ALL files in the repo
assert:is_searching:true
assert:search_query:

# BUG WAS FIXED: Empty search query now shows same as browsing mode
# This should be 19 items (same as browsing), not 0 or all files in repo
assert:visible_files_count:19

# Type a character to see if search works at all
char:s

# Should now only show files matching 's'
assert:search_query:s
# Don't check exact count as it varies, but should be > 0 for files containing 's'

# Backspace to remove the 's' - should go back to showing all files

# Back to empty search query

# BUG WAS FIXED: This should show same as browsing again (19 items)
